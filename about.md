## What is Earl Grey?

Earl Grey is a programming language that compiles down to JavaScript for use on the web or with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It provides a unique Python-like syntax however Earl Grey still has its fare share of unique qualities.

> It's important to remember that even though Earl Grey shares some syntactic qualities of Python, it still has the underlying programmatic interface (builtin functions, types, etc.) of JavaScript.

Earl Grey has working implementations of much of the functionality provided to JavaScript by the ES2015 specification and in fact many features planned for "ES7".  Earl Grey provides a compiler that can compile Earl Grey files (using the `eg` extension), to either "ES5" (browser-compatible) or "ES6" (the new ES2015 specification).

Earl Grey also provides several things beyond what is planned for the future of EcmaScript.  There is a builtin document-building DSL, a macro system, powerful pattern matching, and several other syntactic flourishes that really allow Earl Grey to stand separate from JavaScript and in fact many of the compile-to-js languages.

## About Earl Academy

Some interesting points about this project:

* Idea crafted over the summer of 2015 in Earl Grey's [gitter](https://gitter.im/breuleux/earl-grey).
* Inspired by [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) and [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
* Ideal for [early](http://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/) to intermediate level programmers with some JavaScript experience (perhaps start with the two links in the previous point for absolute beginners).
* Please send your [well-wishes](mailto:madcap.russo+earl-academy@gmail.com), [donations](#), and [contributions](https://github.com/MadcapJake/earl-academy)!
